I'm a final year Dual Degree student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/), [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in), Chennai. I'm interested in broad aspects of computer architecture, with current interest in domain-specific architectures for DL applications and microarchitectural security.

I'm currently working with [Dr. Pratyush Kumar](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~pratyush) in collaboration with [Vinod Ganesan](https://vinod1993.github.io/webpage) in building systolic-array based co-processor for accelerating DL inference on edge devices. The work is part of the [Shakti Processor Program](http://shakti.org.in), in building intelligence-enabled cores. Also, I'm working with [Dr. Chester Rebeiro](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester) in collaboration with Vinod Ganesan and Rahul Bodduna in building a dynamically-configurable secure microrachitecture, which thwarts almost all side-channel attacks. Earlier, I did my summer internship under Prof. Kamakoti in implementing cache-coherence protocol for Shakti C-class processor.
